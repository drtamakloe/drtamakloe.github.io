I am currently a Research Assistant Professor at KAIST ([Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://mo.kaist.ac.kr/news_event/reuben-tamakloe-%EB%B0%95%EC%82%AC-%EC%97%B0%EA%B5%AC%EA%B5%90%EC%88%98-%EC%9E%84%EC%9A%A9/)). I obtained my PhD in Transportation Engineering at the [University of Seoul](https://www.uos.ac.kr/en/), South Korea. Besides, I hold a bachelors degree in Statistics with Mathematics, BSc (Hons) Statistics from the [University of Ghana](https://www.ug.edu.gh/). During my research carreer, I gained in-depth experience in the use of tools like NLOGIT, SPSS, STATA, Gephi, Python, ArcGIS Pro, and R.  

As a researcher, my [research](https://drtamakloe.github.io/publications/) centers on traffic safety and crash injury severity, advanced data analytics and machine learning, urban mobility systems and public transport performance, and emerging mobility technologies, including autonomous systems and electric vehicles, to support safer and more sustainable transportation systems. 

Aside academics, I double as the CEO of Timeless Ghana where I oversee imports and marketing of goods and services. I also work as a Research Fellow at [DONG IL Engineering Consultants Ltd](http://www.dongileng.co.kr/?module=Default&action=Default_e). Here is my [CV](CV/Reuben Tamakloe - CV.pdf).
