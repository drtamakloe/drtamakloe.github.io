I am currently a Research Assistant Professor at KAIST ([Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://mo.kaist.ac.kr/news_event/reuben-tamakloe-%EB%B0%95%EC%82%AC-%EC%97%B0%EA%B5%AC%EA%B5%90%EC%88%98-%EC%9E%84%EC%9A%A9/)). I obtained my PhD in Transportation Engineering at the [University of Seoul](https://www.uos.ac.kr/en/), South Korea. Besides, I hold a bachelors degree in Statistics with Mathematics, BSc (Hons) Statistics from the [University of Ghana](https://www.ug.edu.gh/). During my research carreer, I gained in-depth experience in the use of tools like NLOGIT, SPSS, STATA, Gephi, Python, ArcGIS Pro, and R.  

As a researcher, my [research](https://drtamakloe.github.io/publications/) interests cover two main areas. In the area of **traffic safety**, I employ  data mining, spatial analysis, and advanced econometric modelling techniques for transport safety big data analysis. These days, I am exploring the use of computer vision to understand why crashes happen and investigate traffic conflict situations to prevent crashes from occurring. Regarding **transportation planning**, I use machine learning tools for autonomous vehicle feasibility studies, disaster simulation, and evacuation planning. Besides, I perform sustainable transport-related analysis on integrated multimodal transport networks using artificial intelligence and social network analysis techniques. 

Aside academics, I double as the CEO of Timeless Ghana where I oversee imports and marketing of goods and services. I also work as a Research Fellow at [DONG IL Engineering Consultants Ltd](http://www.dongileng.co.kr/?module=Default&action=Default_e). Here is my [CV](CV/Reuben Tamakloe - CV.pdf).
