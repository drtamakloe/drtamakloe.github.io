I am currently a Research Assistant Professor at KAIST ([Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://mo.kaist.ac.kr/news_event/reuben-tamakloe-%EB%B0%95%EC%82%AC-%EC%97%B0%EA%B5%AC%EA%B5%90%EC%88%98-%EC%9E%84%EC%9A%A9/)). I obtained my PhD in Transportation Engineering at the [University of Seoul](https://www.uos.ac.kr/en/), South Korea. Besides, I hold a bachelors degree in Statistics with Mathematics, BSc (Hons) Statistics from the [University of Ghana](https://www.ug.edu.gh/). During my research carreer, I gained in-depth experience in the use of tools like NLOGIT, SPSS, STATA, Gephi, Python, ArcGIS Pro, and R.  

My [research](https://drtamakloe.github.io/publications/) centers on **traffic safety and crash injury severity**, **advanced data analytics and machine learning**, **urban mobility systems and public transport performance**, and **emerging mobility technologies, including autonomous systems and electric vehicles**, to support safer and more sustainable transportation systems. Here is my [CV](CV/Reuben Tamakloe - CV.pdf).

My research is interdisciplinary in nature. I use **heterogeneity-aware models**, **pattern discovery techniques**, and **spatiotemporal analyses** to uncover high-risk crash mechanisms and explain injury severity outcomes, with **particular attention to vulnerable road users**. **Advanced data analytics and AI** form the methodological core of my work, enabling the study of human–automation interaction risks, safety implications of EVs, AVs, and micromobility, and behavioral adoption under uncertainty. I also apply these methods to integrated public transport, shared mobility, and station-area environments to evaluate system performance, safety differentials, and the role of urban design. Overall, my research aims to generate data-driven insights that support safer, more efficient, and more equitable multimodal urban transportation systems.
