I obtained my PhD in Transportation Engineering at the University of Seoul, South Korea. Besides, I hold a bachelors degree in Statistics with Mathematics, BSc (Hons) Statistics from the University of Ghana. During my research carreer, I gained in-depth experience in the use of tools like NLOGIT, SPSS, STATA, Gephi, Python, ArcGIS Pro, and R.  

As a researcher, my [research](https://drtamakloe.github.io/publications/) interests cover two main areas. In the area of **traffic safety**, I employ  data mining, spatial analysis, and advanced econometric modelling techniques for transport safety big data analysis. Regarding **transportation planning**, I use machine learning tools for disaster simulation and evacuation planning. Besides, I perform sustainable transport-related analysis on integrated multimodal transport networks using artificial intelligence and social network analysis techniques. 

Aside academics, I double as the CEO of Timeless Ghana where I oversee imports and marketing of goods and services. I also work as a  Research Fellow at DONG IL Engineering Consultants Ltd. Here is my [CV](CV/Reuben Tamakloe - CV.pdf).
