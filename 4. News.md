•	2025/04/09 - I am pleased to announce that I was selected for the 2025 Jang Young Sil Fellow Program at KAIST. The Jang Young Sil Fellow Program is a highly competitive Korean government–funded program that supports outstanding early-career researchers with strong potential for scientific and technological innovation. It provides substantial, multi-year funding and national recognition to help fellows lead independent, high-impact research. Being selected is a major achievement because it signals elite research excellence, competitiveness at the national level, and strong leadership potential. The program is named after Jang Young Sil (장영실), a renowned Korean scientist and inventor of the Joseon Dynasty, symbolizing innovation, scientific ingenuity, and national contribution. A big thanks to Prof. Inhi Kim for recommending me and for his guidance.
