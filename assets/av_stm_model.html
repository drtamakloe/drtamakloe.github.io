New vehicle models and variants are increasing the development complexity and hence the overall development time. Therefore, there is a requirement for a vehicle-packaging tool that can translate user inputs into an optimised vehicle package and can be visualised instantly. The aim of this paper is to develop a parametric tool for designing different concepts for electric autonomous buses. The scope of application is intended in the early phase of the vehicle development process to enable a fast and efficient creation of a flexible bus concept. Through a graphical user interface (GUI), the user is able to size and select all the required components for the autonomous vehicle concepts. The vehicle specification is initiated by selection of one of the three classes of vehicle, the desired number of passengers and then the bus interior's seat arrangement design. An appropriate powertrain and chassis will then automatically be configured in the next steps. The HVAC simulation allows for the design of different components of the refrigeration circuit to ensure proper cabin temperature. For evaluating the concept, the energy consumption is analysed through simulations, and an estimated initial cost of vehicle concepts and individual systems completes the concept. A spider chart summarises all characteristics and offers an overview of the vehicle concept, providing the possibility to compare with other concepts simultaneously. The tool can create 9600 different bus concepts and provides interfaces for expansion."],"thought_2":["In the context of automotive applications, complex tasks such as automatic driving of electric vehicles are handled through the composition of several components, each offering a different service. Such component composition is not straightforward and is often subject to bugs that might stem mainly from the incompatibility of services. In other words, in this context, which includes critical services and in which people&#x0027;s life is at stake, detecting and eliminating bugs early at the design stage is crucial and even mandatory. To remedy this issue, we propose in this paper a formal approach for modeling and verifying the reliability of electric self-driving vehicles that are continuously communicating with off-road infrastructures. First, for the modeling phase, SysML language is used to model the system architecture and to specify the connections between its embedded components. Second, we present a formal verification approach based on the extended interface automata formalism to verify the compatibility between the interacting components, and to check whether this set of components achieve their required tasks. This formalism allows to specify component interfaces that exhibit component protocols and system non-functional constraints. The proposed approach permits an algorithmic verification to decide whether a set of components, when assembled together, fulfill compatibility conditions. Results in this paper show, on one hand, that SysML and extended interface automata formalism are relevant to model and capture component features in the context of automotive systems, on the other hand, that our methodology allows to develop autonomous electric vehicle systems correct-by-design, regarding to component compatibility.

This paper reviews the efforts and progress associated with the various aspects of ethical challenges in autonomous vehicles. Based on the critical review, it is clear that a consistent solution for ethical challenges does not currently exist and recommendations are provided, to potentially encourage the involving players to collaborate to tackle the remaining challenges."],"thought_2":["The onset of autonomous driving has provided fertile ground for discussions about ethics in recent years. These discussions are heavily documented in the scientific literature and have mainly revolved around extreme traffic situations depicted as moral dilemmas, i.e. situations in which the autonomous vehicle (AV) is required to make a difficult moral choice. Quite surprisingly, little is known about the ethical issues in focus by the AV industry. General claims have been made about the struggles of companies regarding the ethical issues of AVs but these lack proper substantiation. As private companies are highly influential on the development and acceptance of AV technologies, a meaningful debate about the ethics of AVs should take into account the ethical issues prioritised by industry. In order to assess the awareness and engagement of industry on the ethics of AVs, we inspected the narratives in the official business and technical reports of companies with an AV testing permit in California. The findings of our literature and industry review suggest that: (i) given the plethora of ethical issues addressed in the reports, autonomous driving companies seem to be aware of and engaged in the ethics of autonomous driving technology; (ii) scientific literature and industry reports prioritise safety and cybersecurity; (iii) scientific and industry communities agree that AVs will not eliminate the risk of accidents; (iv) scientific literature on AV technology ethics is dominated by discussions about the trolley problem; (v) moral dilemmas resembling trolley cases are not addressed in industry reports but there are nuanced allusions that unravel underlying concerns about these extreme traffic situations; (vi) autonomous driving companies have different approaches with respect to the authority of remote operators; and (vii) companies seem invested in a lowest liability risk design strategy relying on rules and regulations, expedite investigations, and crash/collision avoidance algorithms."],"prob":["research, technolog, paper, futur, focus, discuss, autonom"],"frex":["review, industri, research, automot, discuss, literatur, highlight"],"lift":["academ, industri, overview, review, summar, ethic, decad"],"score":["review, research, technolog, ethic, industri, survey, compani"],"proportion":["0.05"]}],"topic_no":[1,2]},{"name":["travel, system, cost, demand, time, share, model"],"children":[{"name":["fleet, rout, charg, demand, equilibrium, amod, assign"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[8],"thought_1":["This paper studies a mixed-service operation of shared-use autonomous mobility systems (SAMS) where customers can request rides either immediately or through reservations and use the vehicle for a point-to-point service or a time-slot-based rental service, respectively.

The mathematical formulations attempt to achieve a good trade-off between the wait times of reservation-based users and on-demand users, while minimizing overall empty fleet miles. A case study in Chicago is presented using taxi data, and the combined mixed-service fleet operation is compared with a case with two separate operations: one for an on-demand point-to-point service and one for a reservation-based time-slot rental service.

The evaluation considers the operational cost and average passenger level-of-service trade-offs as well as distributional differences in waiting times. Two case studies are used to evaluate such trade-offs under different fleet compositions; (1) a simple circular network feeder service; (2) a case based on a real-world coordinated branched service in Stockholm, combining fixed-line services on the trunk portion with a flexible feeder service on the branches. Results for the circular network indicate that there are benefits in utilizing an on-demand operational policy for the lowest and highest demand levels tested. When fixed service capacity is exceeded, it is found that there are potential benefits in on-demand operations with respect to average level-of-service, as well as delivering a more even distribution of passenger waiting times. Results for the real-world case show that combining DRT on branches with fixed services on the trunk improves the overall median waiting times for all DRT scenarios and provides substantial improvements for passengers on the trunk, at the cost of more variable, and less equitable waiting times on the branches. For larger fleet sizes, generalized travel costs are reduced with and without rebalancing and level-of service provided to branch-to-branch passengers is improved considerably by rebalancing idling vehicles to branch end-stops.

SILO was integrated with MATSim for the Austin region. Land-use and travel results were generated for a business-asusual case (BAU) of 0% self-driving or autonomous vehicles (AVs) over the model timeframe versus a scenario in which households' value of travel time savings (VTTS) was reduced by 50% to reflect the travel-burden reductions of no longer having to drive. A third scenario was also compared and examined against BAU to understand the impacts of rising vehicle occupancy (VO) and/or higher roadway capacities due to dynamic ride-sharing (DRS) options in shared AV (SAV) fleets. Results suggested an 8.1% increase in average work-trip times when VTTS fell by 50% and VO remained unaffected (the 100% AV scenario) and a 33.3% increase in the number of households with extreme work-trips (over 1 hour, each way) in the final model year (versus BAU of 0% AVs). When VO was raised to 2.0 and VTTS fell instead by 25% (the HiDRS SAV scenario), average work-trip times increased by 3.5% and the number of households with extreme work-trips increased by 16.4% in the final model year (versus BAU of 0% AVs). The model also predicted 5.3% fewer households and 19.1% more available, developable land in the city of Austin in the 100% AV scenario in the final model year relative to the BAU scenario's final year, with 5.6% more households and 10.2% less developable land outside the city.

One such model is rJourney that estimates travel demand among thousands of regions and models mode and destination choice. rJourney includes records representing 1.17 billion long-distance trips throughout the year 2010. Although inter-regional impacts caused by an increase of automated vehicles (AVs) has been investigated, there is little research on inter-regional travel and how longer distance destination and mode choices will change. Because of conveniences offered by AVs, the value of travel time of drivers is expected to fall, thus reducing the generalized cost of AV travel. To initially analyze the impacts of AVs in the United States, a new AV mode was added to a subset of the rJourney mode and destination choice models. With an initial scenario assuming an operating cost of AVs that is 118% of traditional cars, two outcomes are observed that are solely based on model results. First, the attractiveness of AVs severely digs into the airline travel market, reducing airline revenues to 53%. Second, the introduction of AVs results in a shift of destination choice, increasing travel in further distances for personal vehicles, but favoring closer distances across all modes, for an overall 6.7% decline in US passenger-miles traveled on existing long-distance trips. While this preliminary research has revealed an initial perspective on how an existing model can support AVs, the increasing availability of data as AVs emerge will refine nationwide long-distance modeling."],"prob":["travel, share, park, model, time, trip, choic"],"frex":["park, trip, commut, choic, travel, household, share"],"lift":["fare, greenhous, privately-own, commut, household, metropolitan, park"],"score":["travel, trip, park, ownership, household, commut, privat"],"proportion":["0.05"]}],"topic_no":[8,16]},{"name":["attitud, accept, perceiv, trust, respond, survey, older"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[4],"thought_1":["We explored the structure of public attitudes on whether self-driving vehicles (SDVs) should be allowed on public roads, through a four-way typology of attitudes (positive, negative, ambivalent, and indifferent).

It provides a concrete implementation model for SAVs set to improve equity in accessibility and highlights the need of regulation in order for SAVs to help overcome identified spatial mismatches. Methodology Through the formulation of linear regression models, the relationship between land-use and transportation accessibility (by car and public transport) and socio-economic well-being indicators is tested on district-level in four European cities: Paris, Berlin, London and Vienna. Accessibility data is used to analyse access to points of interest within given timespans by both car and public transport. To measure equity in socio-economic well-being, three district-level proxies are introduced: yearly income, unemployment rate and educational attainment. Results In the cities of Paris, London and Vienna, as well as partially in Berlin, positive effects of educational attainment on accessibility are evidenced. Further, positive effects on accessibility by yearly income are found in Paris and London. Additionally, negative effects of an increased unemployment rate on accessibility are observed in Paris and Vienna. Through the comparison between accessibility by car and public transportation in the districts of the four cities, the potential for SAVs is evidenced.

Thus, they should have the ability to understand the lane changing intentions of surrounding human-driven vehicles. Unlike human drivers, the state-of-the-art models used in autonomous vehicles recognize a driver's lane changing intention based on the target vehicle's lateral movement, which leaves little to no time for the autonomous vehicle to react. In this paper, a Human-like Lane Changing Intention Understanding Model (HLCIUM) for autonomous driving is proposed to understand the lane changing intentions of surrounding vehicles. By imitating the selective attention mechanism of human vision systems, the proposed model emulates the way human drivers concentrate on the surrounding vehicles and recognizes their lane changing intentions accordingly. The velocity changes of the surrounding vehicles are treated as the lane changing hints, and the attention is drawn to the corresponding vehicle following a saliency-based scheme. Then, the lane changing intention is identified by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based intention recognizer. The proposed model is tested with Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) vehicle trajectory dataset, and the proposed method has reached 90.89% in detecting lane changing intention and 88.58% in lane keeping in urban road scenarios, and reached 87.73% and 87.48% for the lane changing and lane keeping intentions in highway scenarios, respectively. Importantly, the average recognition time before the lane changing maneuver of the proposed model is 6.67 seconds for the urban road datasets and 7.08 seconds for the highway datasets, which is far earlier than state-of-the-art models.

Then, an interactive motion prediction method based on game theory is established to predict the interaction behaviours possibility and future local trajectories of surrounding vehicles.

Because it is not realistic to evaluate every single test condition in real-world traffic, computer simulation methods can be used. The driving safety performance can be evaluated by simulating various driving scenarios and calculating surrogate indicators representing dangerous collision risk. This study used a near-miss database and introduced a surrogate indicator that represents a potential risk in the driving scenarios for rear-end and cut-in collisions. The near-miss video database includes several driving scenarios experienced by human drivers, such as dangerous situations that lead to accidents, potentially dangerous situations that have a risk probability to escalate into dangerous situations, and normal driving situations. A skilled and attentive human driver foresees dangerous situations while driving and avoids them. Therefore, autonomous driving vehicles, which should be safer than human driving, must avoid potentially dangerous situations, as well as overtly dangerous ones. Level 3 autonomous driving vehicles must be safely operated to prevent potentially dangerous situations for rear-end collisions and cut-in collisions, which are the most frequent danger cases on highways. A calculation method of surrogate indicators to predict the severity of driving scenarios for rear-end and cut-in collisions was developed. The near-miss video database was used to validate that these indicators can illustrate risk probabilities and help assess dangerous situations. Thus, dangerous situations and potentially dangerous situations in the driving scenarios for rear-end and cut-in collisions were quantified using the surrogate indicators, and the driving safety performance of autonomous driving vehicles could be evaluated."],"thought_2":["In this study we developed an autonomous braking algorithm to satisfy both safety and ride comfort of a vehicle.

Further, the partial braking is divided into a recovery and a release zones. The former is to apply braking pressures for the safe deceleration, whereas the latter is to release the braking pressure smoothly for good ride comfort. To determine the partial braking pressures, the nonlinear characteristics of the tire friction is considered and the linear momentum of a preceding vehicle is calculated based on the extrapolation of its motion.

Object detectors are trained on a finite amount of data within a specific domain, hampering detection performance when applying object detectors to samples fromother domains during inference, an effect knownas domain gap. Domain gap is a concern for data-driven applications, evoking repetitive retraining of networks when the applications unfold into other domains. With object detectors that have been trained on day images only, a domain gap can be observed in object detection by night. Training object detectors on night images is critical because of the enormous effort required to generate an adequate amount of diversely labeled data, and existing data sets often tend to overfit specific domain characteristics. For the first time, this work proposes adapting domains by online image-to-image translation to expand an object detector's domain of operation. The domain gap is decreased without additional labeling effort and without having to retrain the object detector while unfolding into the target domain. The approach follows the concept of domain adaptation, shifting the target domain samples into the domain knownto the object detector (source domain). Firstly, the UNIT network is trained for domain adaptation and subsequently cast into an online domain adaptation module, which narrows down the domain gap. Domain adaptation capabilities are evaluated qualitatively by displaying translated samples and visualizing the domain shift through the 2D tSNE algorithm. We quantitatively benchmark the domain adaptation's influence on a state-of-the-art object detector, and on a retrained object detector, formeanaverage precision, mean recall, and the resulting F1-score.

Different from the previous solutions, the auxiliary domain is composed of original source images and synthetic images that are translated from source images to the similar ones in the target domain. DAYOLO based on YOLOv5s is designed with a category-consistent regularization module and adaptation modules for image-level and instance-level features to generate domain invariant representations. Our proposed method is trained and evaluated by using five public driving datasets including Cityscapes, Foggy Cityscapes, BDD100K, KITTI, and KAIST. Experiment results demonstrate that object detection performance is significantly improved when using our proposed method in various domain shift scenarios for autonomous driving applications.

With the flourishing of convolution neural networks, responsible depth estimation of stereo matching with artificial intelligence is the most severe challenge for autonomous driving in recent years. Previous research on end-to-end trainable stereo matching networks has usually used cascading convolution blocks with down-sampling or pooling operations to extract the unary features required for matching cost construction. Such approaches lack a reconstruction stage for increasing feature map pixel-wise alignment and strength, factors which play an important role in representing the similarity between stereo image pairs. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the progressive fusion stereo matching network (PFSM-Net). We exploit an encoder-decoder feature extraction network architecture for multi-stage and -scale dynamic feature extraction. Moreover, we propose a group-wise concatenation method to construct the cost volume, which provides a more efficient cost volume for cost aggregation. Furthermore, we propose the use of multi-scale cost aggregation networks with a progressive fusion strategy. The aggregated cost volume is progressively fused with the multi-stage and -scale cost volume as the size of the cost volume increases. Multi-stage and -scale outputs are supervised with and learned in a coarse-to-fine manner.

Finally, the feature maps and the relative pose are further applied to compute the feature-metric loss for training the depth completion network.

In this study, the benefits of 3DMA GNSS are further extended to the GNSS/inertial navigation system (INS) integration system. Based on the shadow matching solution and scoring information of candidate positions, two methods are proposed to better classify the line-of-sight (LOS) and NLOS satellite measurements.

NLOS is currently the dominant factor degrading the performance of GNSS positioning. Recently, the camera has been employed to detect the NLOS and then to exclude the NLOS measurements from GNSS calculation. The exclusion of NLOS measurements can cause severe distortion of satellite distribution, due to the excessive NLOS receptions in deep urban canyons. Correcting the NLOS receptions with the aid of 3D light detection and ranging after detection of NLOS receptions using a fish-eye camera was proposed in this study.

However, signals outperformed reservations in a congested network with several close local road and arterial intersections because the capacity allocations of signals were more optimized for the network. Reservations also were less efficient than were traditional merges and diverges for on- and off-ramps.
